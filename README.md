## Usage

Have some file(s) which have somewhere in them specified the supported version. Replace the version with: `<!-- SUPPORTED_BEE_START -->1.2.0<!-- SUPPORTED_BEE_END -->`. 
This is a comment in Markdown which is used to mark where the replacement should happen for the action. 

**The project has to have `package-lock.json` file which in some of its direct or indirect dependencies has `bee-js`.**

```yaml
name: Update supported Bee version

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'master'

jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Check and update the Bee version
        uses: ethersphere/upload-supported-bee-action@master
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PTA_TOKEN }}
          files: README.md
```
